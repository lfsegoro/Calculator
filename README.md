# Calculator
Learn OOP in making calculator project.

I am currently just start learning python. Also I want also learn OOP, so I force this coding using OOP paradigm.
Currently in console mode only, I want it progress to GUI based application.
And I want it use all programming language feature.
All above will be implemented while learning. Thats my hopes and plan.
I am opening to other idea and discussion.
